                        <p> HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
                            It is a protocol used to access the data on the World Wide Web (www).
                            The HTTP protocol can be used to transfer the data in the form of plain
                            text, hypertext, audio, video, and so on.
                            HTTP is similar to the FTP as it also transfers the files from
                            one host to another host.
                            But, HTTP is simpler than FTP as HTTP uses only one connection,
                            i.e., no control connection to transfer the files.</p>

                            between a website and the web browser.
                            It is widely used on the internet and used for secure communications.
                            Those websites which need login credentials should use the HTTPS protocol
                            for sending the data.</p>

                        <p> HTML 1.0: The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version of
                            HTML language, and it was released in 1995.
                            HTML 2.0: This was the next version which was released in 1996, and it was
                            standard language version for website design. HTML 2.0 was able to support extra
                            features such as form-based file upload, form elements such as text box, option
                            button, etc.
                            HTML 3.2: HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1998. This version was
                            capable of creating tables and providing support for extra options for form elements.
                            It can also support a web page with complex mathematical equations. It became an
                            official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported
                            by most of the browsers.

                            provides added support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting ability for various
                            multimedia elements.
                            HTML5 : HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first draft

                        <p>
                            Attributes are simply properties of tags.
                            We can change properties of tag like color , background color
                            , size vice versa.

                            Attributes must be provided into opening tag.
                            Attributes must be in the pattern of   attribute = “value”

                            To provide horizontal line we have to use &lt;hr&gt; tag.
                            We can increase height by using height attribute.

                            known as HTML ELEMENT.
                            We can provide elements inside another element.
                            Example :   &lt;h1&gt;My webpage &lt;/h1&gt;
                            Elements which does not have content are known as empty

                        <p>
                            To make more interactive pages we can provide images in
                            HTML.
                            To provide image in HTML we have to use &lt;img&gt; 
                            &lt;img&gt; tag is self closing tag

                            Src attribute is used to provide source of file.
                            Alt attribute is used to provide alternative text for image
                            If we do not provide height and width image will take its
                            original resolution.

                            3. INLINE BLOCK LEVEL
                            <b>1.BLOCK LEVEL ELEMENT : </b>

                            known as block level elements.
                            Block level elements width depends on browser width.
                            Height and width can be changed for Block Level Elements.
